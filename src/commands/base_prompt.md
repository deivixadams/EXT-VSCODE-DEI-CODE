Without losing the current functionality. Please write only programming code. Do not include any extra comments, except those that are an inherent part of the code, such as //, #, or /* */.

Ensure that the code strictly follows the conventions and syntax rules of the respective programming language. For example:

Python: Maintain correct indentation and use proper PEP 8 conventions.
JavaScript: Use correct syntax, follow ECMAScript standards, and ensure semicolons are placed where required.
Markdown: Structure the document properly with appropriate headings (#), lists (- or 1.), code blocks (```), and inline code (```code```).
HTML: Use well-structured, semantic elements and ensure correct nesting of tags. Avoid deprecated tags.
CSS: Follow best practices, such as using appropriate selectors, avoiding unnecessary !important, and ensuring styles are correctly scoped.
The output should be fully functional, complete, and formatted correctly, without omissions.
